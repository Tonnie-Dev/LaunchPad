## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture üõ†Ô∏è

LaunchPad is implemented using Android Clean Architecture and follows the Model-View-ViewModel 
(MVVM) pattern.

It features these main 3 layers:

**1. Data Layer** - This is the layer that dispenses data to the LaunchPad app. It features 2 
RemoteMediators (yes, :two: ) to provide paging functionality. It is flanked by a ROOM Database 
for data persistence. The API provides the remote data which is cached by the mediators 
into the ROOM database for offline operations.

**2. Domain Layer** - This layer holds the Business Logic for the LaunchApp. It holds the models and 
the use cases that  encapsulates the very complex business logic for the  app.

**3. UI Layer** - This is the presentation layer which directly interacts with the user. It displays
the  refined data to the user and facilitates interactions with the user.
It contains the ViewModel holding the different states for the Yummies App.

Launch has 4 Screen destinations which use Compose Destination to manage navigation.

| Splash Screen         | Overview Screen       | Detailed Screen       | Full Screen           |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| ![](./gifs/gif_1.gif) | ![](./gifs/gif_2.gif) | ![](./gifs/gif_3.gif) | ![](./gifs/gif_4.gif) |

### **Overview Screen** 
This screen is based on both TabLayout thanks to [**Accompanist Library**](https://github.com/google/accompanist). You can go into more details by following LaunchPad's tab implementation or [this blog](https://johncodeos.com/how-to-create-tabs-with-jetpack-compose/).

### **Details Screen**
The user navigates to the Details Screen by clicking on a launch item. The main feature is
the BottomSheet. The user can scroll up and down to reveal additional Launch details such as **Status**,
 **Mission** and **Launch Site**,


### **Full Screen**
When the user clicks on the full screen icon from the details screen, the app navigates to
the full screen to display the rocket image in full screen.

## :electric_plug: **API Reference** :electric_plug:
Yummies fetches its data from [**Launch Library 2 API**](https://thespacedevs.com/llapi/).
You can find the API Documentation by following this [link](https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/swagger/).

## :gear: Technologies used :gear:

LaunchPad project uses many popular libraries and tools in the Android Ecosystem

* [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) - helps to write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
* [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - modern toolkit for building native Android UI
* [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/) - an adaptable system of guidelines, components, and tools that support the best practices of user interface design.
* [Compose Destinations](https://github.com/raamcosta/compose-destinations) - used to handle all navigations and arguments passing while hiding the complex, non-type-safe and boilerplate code
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
* [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - used for Dependency Injection.
* [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) - an image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) a REST Client for Android which makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice.
* [Coroutines and Kotlin Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - used to manage the local storage i.e. `writing to and reading from the database`. Coroutines help in managing background threads and reduces the need for callbacks.
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) persistence library which provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
* [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - a logger with a small, extensible API which provides utility on top of Android's normal Log class.
* [Lottie Animations](https://lottiefiles.com/) - provides Lightweight and scalable animations files
## :hammer_and_pick: Architecture :hammer_and_pick:
Yummies is implemented using Android Clean Architecture with these key highlights:

Uses Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern with Clean Architecture (data, domain and presentation)
## Data Layer
The Data layer features a single repository flanked by  
a ROOM Database for data persistence and remote data from the API. The API provides
the remote data which is cached by the repository into the ROOM database for offline operations.
## Domain Layer
This layer houses the meal and category models and the use cases which encapsulates
the complex business logic for the Yummies app.
## UI Layer
Displays the Yummies refined data on the screen and facilitates interactions with the users.
It contains the ViewModel holding the different states for the Yummies App.

It has 3 Screen destinations which use Compose Destination to manage navigation.

#Overview Screen 1
This screen is based on both LazyColumn and LazyRow to present categories 
and recipes options.

There is also a search box where you can search a meal by name.

#Details Screen
You get here by selecting a specific meal item and the app navigates you
to the details screen.

You can now see an image of final cooked meals and ingredients. Pull up
the bottom sheet to reveal the cooking directions
